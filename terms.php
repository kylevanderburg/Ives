    <p><strong>Ives</strong> is a scheduling tool designed to facilitate appointment booking for academic and studio use. By using this tool, you agree to the following terms:</p>

    <h4>1. Purpose</h4>
    <p>Ives is intended for use by students, faculty, and staff to schedule meetings, lessons, or consultations. It may not be used for commercial or non-academic purposes without permission.</p>

    <h4>2. Privacy</h4>
    <p>Ives does not store personal information, meeting notes, or private calendar content on its servers. All scheduling is done through secure Microsoft Graph API connections, and event data is stored within the organizer's institutional calendar.</p>

    <h4>3. Responsibility</h4>
    <p>While Ives facilitates appointment scheduling, it is the responsibility of both parties to attend meetings as scheduled and to communicate in the event of cancellations or changes.</p>

    <h4>4. FERPA Compliance</h4>
    <p>Ives is designed with FERPA considerations in mind. It does not request, record, or transmit student academic records or sensitive data.</p>

    <h4>5. Changes</h4>
    <p>These terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of Ives implies acceptance of any changes.</p>
